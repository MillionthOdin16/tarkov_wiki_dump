    "In the PMC mode, you play as your main character hired by a private military company (eitherUSECorBEAR). You start by selecting alocationand time of day then enter the raid either solo or with teammates. You can bring in weapons, armor and gear from your own stash. As a PMC operator, you may engage and kill other PMCs,BossesorScavs. In order to survive the raid and escape with any items you are carrying, you must locate and move into an extraction zone, of which the list is available in-game by double-tapping the \"O\" key. If you die during the raid or do not extract in time, all items except your melee weapon, armband and items in yoursecure containerare left behind.",
    "In summary:",
    "Practice/Co-op modes settings",
    "When preparing to play as a PMC, you will be shown a screen that allows you to enable \"practice mode\". This gameplay mode is intended for exploring locations, testing weapons and other activities. It offers the option to tweak different settings like AI amount/difficulty, toggling bosses, randomizing time/weather and more. Additionally, it is also possible to practice with, or play against other players in the \"Co-op mode\". This mode comes with its own set of tweakable settings like spawning together or separated. Currently, the co-op mode is only playable by players that own the \"Edge of Darkness\" edition of the game.",
    "When playing in practice or co-op mode, no progress is saved upon raid completion or termination. This means that you may disconnect from either with no penalty whatsoever.",
    "See:Scav game mode",
    "This page covers the basics of combat and survival inEscape from Tarkov.",
    "Upon starting the game for the very first time, you will be greeted by the following message:",
    "In this game, you will fight for your life and survive the perils of Tarkov, a Russian cityin the Norvinsk region on the brink of chaos and collapse. Your character is an operator of aPrivate Military Company (PMC), caught in a maelstrom of events right after the ContractWars. The area is sealed off, and your operational command is not responding; previous missionobjectives have lost their purpose. Everybody has personal goals now - adapt and survive,escape the blockade or try to save others.",
    "Be prepared to die and lose everything you had with you in every raid you enter.Keep in mind that every drop in your internet connection or network hardware malfunctioncan lead to disconnection from the game with the consecutive death of your character andloss of all the gear you had with you or found within your raid.",
    "Yes, you will die, and most probably very often, but remember - this is still a game. Best of luckout there!",
    "Escape from Tarkovcan be purchased on theofficial websiteas a \"pre-order\". Pre-orders are able to download and play immediately after purchase. The client can be downloaded fromyour profile pageby clicking the large \"Install\" button.",
    "Once the game has finished downloading and you've launched it for the first time, you'll be asked some questions, starting with what language and name you want to use. You are able to change your name once every 14 days, so don't feel too locked into it! Next comes your first major choice, what faction to use? You have the options ofBEARandUSEC. Your choice of faction will decide what weapons and gear you start with, along with some other differences. The first is thatBEARonly speak using Russian voice lines whileUSECspeak English. This can be important for communicating with (or taunting) other players in-game. The second difference is your choice of cosmetictactical clothing. There are a few other minor differences, such astraderdialogues and different facial options.",
    "Movement inEscape From Tarkovis more than simply sprinting or walking. It is handled differently than most other first-person shooters, with the movement model trying to mimic the actual performance of a soldier encumbered with gear and weapons. It allows you to move at varying speeds, from a snail's pace which generates the least amount of audible noise, to a sprint, which may compromise your position.",
    "The way you move through a level is just as important as your ability to gun down a target in a single shot. When moving through the terrain of a map, stepping on broken glass and tile, stepping on a pile of metal debris, or walking through a bush, everything generates a different sound cue which your opponent can use to narrow down your position. Slow, steady, and thoughtful movement should be your mainstays. Be it something as simple as moving across an abandoned street, or as complex as repositioning in a firefight to flank your unsuspecting foe. How you move, how you're postured, and when you move are all vital aspects of consideration.",
    "Be warned,Headsetsamplify your footsteps in clear, crisp, HD surround sound. They are a powerful tool against even the power of slow walking, and can render even the stealthiest players flatfooted when an errant footstep is heard through them.",
    "Just as important as Movement inEscape From Tarkov, how you stand can make a world of difference to your overall ability to survive. Knowing when to duck is just as vital as knowing when to move. The ability to vary your stance, combined with the movement options that the game provides, permits a huge amount of flexibility in terms of tactical agility and how you can engage an opponent.",
    "However, whilst the three standard stances are available, you are able to shift between a slew of different postures. By pressing the following keys:C+Mousewheel Up/Mousewheel Down(Default)Doing such enables you to peek over cover that would otherwise be impossible to see or fire over.",
    "Weaponry inEscape From Tarkovis your bread and butter and could have a guide written about it three times the length of this one. Be it a simple sidearm or a lead-throwing M4 with extended magazines. The choice of what you go into a raid with is entirely yours, excluding when one goes in as aScavenger. Firearm performance will vary wildly depending on what modifications you use, and how you use them. Learning an individual weapon's handling and kinks, be it modified heavily or a stock variant, is vital to your overall success against other players and AI opposition. The depth of the weapon systems cannot be overstated, or overlooked.",
    "Ammunitionis arguably far more important than modifications on a weapon, as ammo choices determine the ability of a bullet to kill an opponent whereas weapon modifications can only aid in landing shots. As a general rule of thumb, if you want to shoot at a player center mass, you are best off using the ammunition with the highest penetration stats possible, given budget restrictions. You may be able to \"Leg meta\" other players by using high flesh damage rounds and aiming for non armored areas of a player, typically the legs. However, this approach requires multiple successive hits to drain the entire health pool of a player, rather than eliminating just the head or thorax.",
    "Equipment inEscape From Tarkovcovers a breadth of items, from body armor to backpacks. Knowing what to bring along with you on a raid is critical to ensuring your success financially, and overall survival. Things like headsets, backpacks, vests, and body armor, are everywhere.",
    "What grade of armor you're wearing matters significantly, as Class II protection will do you no good against a rifle round. Just as Class VI protection will stop everything but large caliber armor piercing ammo. One important consideration is head protection. The head hitbox inEscape from Tarkovis divided into 5 segments: Top, Nape, Ears, Eyes and Jaws. Different helmets will cover different segments.",
    "To choose your equipment, you are faced with three factors : Availability, Price, and Quality. An expensive loadout like the following:SSO Attack 2 raid backpack+6B43 6A Zabralo-Sh body armor+Velocity Systems MPPV Multi-Purpose Patrol Vestcan hold a lot of magazines, meds, loot and will protect you from a great variety of threats, but is going to be hard to come by if you don't have much money and hightraderloyalty levels. On the other hand, a cheap loadout like theScav Vest+MBSS Backpackis not going to protect you and won't let you take a lot of loot on the way back, but is way cheaper and available at an early stage of the game. Also, bringing high-end weaponry alongside low-end gear is a risk, of course. You could lose the fight easily and thus lose your gun. You can find this type of gear onScavs, so don't hesitate looting the ones you kill for easy and free loadouts:Scavssometimes are found with aScav backpackor possibly even, thePilgrim Backpack, which is even bigger, alongside many other pieces of equipment. You can check the following pages to learn more about the different options Tarkov has to offer:",
    "Grenadesare quite tricky to aim inEscape from Tarkovdue to the absence of a crosshair. Using the guide below will help you throw grenades accurately.",
    "Pink lines drawn between the fingers showing where to aim a grenade when throwing.",
    "Insurance allows you to retrieve any items that have not been extracted from the raid, after a delay.",
    "Except for raids onThe Lab, make sure to always insure the gear you go out with using the Insurance Screen, just before entering the lobby. You can click on the \"Insure All\" button to make sure that you select all of your belongings. To confirm, press the \"Insure\" button just above \"Ready\". You can choose to insure withPrapororTherapist:",
    "Use the insurance system, even at a low level: There's always the chance that your killer won't loot you, or leave your items behind as they find better gear. And if ascavkills you, there's a high chance you'll get everything back.",
    "Your insurer will contact you a few hours/days later to let you know what came back. You can then claim it from the messenger tab. If you do not claim it in 96 hours (Prapor) or 144 hours (Therapist), the insured items will be lost.",
    "There are no penalties for insurance fraud. If you have an identical insured piece of equipment to one you find, you can swap for the uninsured item. If you extract with the new item, you will need to make sure to re-insure it. If the item you swapped out is not looted, you can get it back through insurance normally for additional profit.",
    "There is also an upgrade to theHideoutthat reduces your item return time by 15%. It is provided by upgrading the Intelligence Center module to level 2.",
    "",
    "The medical and health systems in Escape from Tarkov are very in-depth, but simple to understand at a glance once you know what you're looking at. One large difference between Tarkov and other games is that using meds takes time, rendering you vulnerable and exposed. Also creating noise from the jostling and necessary movements to use them. The health system as a whole is broken down into hitpoints, every body part has its own HP value and potential status effects that can be applied to it. Some are positive, whilst others are assuredly negative. Your average PMC or Scav has a total of 440 Health Points, set across 7 body parts: Head, Thorax, Stomach, Legs and Arms.",
    "There are three colors indicating the state of each body part: Grey, Red and Black. Grey means the body part is fine or only slightly damaged. Red means that a limb is critically low on HP and at risk for being reduced to 0 HP. Black means, in the most simple of terms, destroyed. Or, as it has been termed, \"Blacked.\" When a body part has reached 0 HP, it cannot be healed via normal means and requires the use of a specialized surgical kit to restore it. Any further damage taken to a body part that has been blacked is distributed to the other parts at reduced, equal or higher rates depending on what part it is. In the simplest terms, damaging a part with 0 HP still does damage to the rest of the body. On top of those three states are various kinds ofstatus effectsyou'll encounter.",
    "Eventually, you're going to take damage. For when that happens, you're going to needMeds. There are various types and sorts of meds with a slew of purposes. All have a \"charge\" and cost to use, some only having a single charge. One of the most deadly status effects a player can suffer is bleeding. Thankfully all medical kits, excluding theAI-2 medkit, can stop bleeding, including bandages. However, if a medical kit lacks sufficient charge to stop bleeding, it will only heal the body part. Other status effects can prove troublesome and debilitating, and often you may either simply lack the means to completely treat them. There are stopgap measures, however. A broken leg or arm requires anAluminum splintto completely treat, for example. But in a pinch,Painkillers,Morphineand other similar meds can enable you to come out on top. Allowing you to keep running even if your legs are blacked, stop coughing if your stomach is dead, or even take more HP damage than normal and still survive.",
    "However, having a body part blacked in raid isn't the end of the world. Beyond the various means of mitigating the problems created by having a body part blacked, a player has the option of outright restoring that part back to functionality outright. This can be done with either theCMS surgical kitor theSurv12 field surgical kit. However, using either will only restore the blacked limb to 1 HP, and will limit it's total overall HP for the remainder of the raid. This effect is cumulative, so using a surgical kit repeatedly will reduce the maximum HP even further. The thorax and head are however incapable of being restored whilst in a raid.",
    "As a PMC, post-raid, either via successful extraction or otherwise, your health and status effects will carry over. During the post-raid summary, you will be given the option of paying roubles to restore your health and remove the various effects impacting your PMC. This is not recommend, as you both lose the XP gained from healing, and it is incredibly overpriced. Utilizing found/purchased meds is vastly more cost-effective in both the short and long term. And as your body parts are restored to a minimum of 1 HP, this means that you are not required to use a surgical kit to restore a part back to full health.  The free alternative however is to simply wait until the passive regeneration provided by yourhideoutrestores you to full health. This however can take up to an hour without upgrades, and as such, is ill-advised.",
    "Each map has multiple extraction points where you can leave the raid after a certain amount of time. To see the available extractions, double tapO. The extractions will be different for each raid depending on your spawn point and if you're playing as a PMC (USEC/BEAR) or as aScav.",
    "Some exits are always available, whilst others are only occasionally available (indicated by question marks). You can check if certain exits are available from afar by looking for active lamps, spotlights, or green smoke. Some extractions may also require a certain amount ofRoublesper person. Others may even require special items to utilize, such asparacordorkeys.",
    "On maps likeThe Lab,Reserve,Interchange, andCustoms, special actions are needed in order to use some extraction points.",
    "For example, on Reserve, the Scav lands extract requires you to team up with a scav to extract, and after extracting at this extract, you will receive a reward from Fence.",
    "Sometimes the name of an extract is shown in green or red. Red means that one or multiple players already left the map through that extract. Green means you are close to an extract, but not close enough to extract yourself. When you are inside an extraction zone, a timer will appear in the top right corner, and you will leave the map as soon as it hits zero. Extraction times can be between few seconds and a couple of minutes.",
    "Time, in EFT, passes 7x faster than real time.  So, for every minute that passes in real life, 7 minutes will have elapsed within the game world.",
    "Location on the map, visibility to the horizon and the weather (clouds/rain) will all factor into how dark/light these periods of time are.",
    "All raid locations (except Labs), when selected on the map screen, will display two clocks to select from for the time of day the raid will occur.  The two clocks always display times which are 12 hours apart from each other.  The Factory location clocks are static and fixed at 15:38 and 03:38.  You'll see the clocks for the other maps show time elapsing at the 7x rate mentioned above.",
    "Labs location is underground and lighting in a raid is always the same, regardless of the time of day, so no time selection is necessary.",
    "While the day/night cycle visibly changes at the accelerated 7x rate, passage of time on your raid countdown display is the same as IRL.",
    "There are many quests inEscape from Tarkov. Some require you to pick stuff up for certaintraders, while others require you to kill other operators or mark vehicles or specific places.\nQuests are the fastest way of gainingEXPinEscape from Tarkov. Completing one will often reward you with thousands, if not tens of thousands ofEXPpoints.\nOn top of the experience, quests reward you with:",
    "InEscape from Tarkov, the beginning size of your Stash is entirely dependent on what edition of the game you buy. The basic edition of the game yields a 10x28 cell Stash, while the Edge of Darkness edition allows you to store items in a 10x68 cell Stash. Here are the different stash sizes available for now:",
    "With the 0.12 update and the addition of theHideout, it was made possible to increase the player's stash size through upgrading the stash module within the hideout from level 1 to 4.",
    "It is recommended that you keep all items of a similar category (weapons, helmets, bags, healing objects) close to each other in order to minimize the time spent in the menu and maximize the action.",
    "At some point in a patch, you will feel limited by the size of your stash, even in more expensive editions of the game. This is whereContainerscome in. These items allow you to store more than the stash space they occupy. For example, theItem caseis a 16 cells item (4x4), but can offer 64 storage cells (8x8). These containers are rather high level items, and apart from theItem case, there exists category specific containers as well. TheAmmunition caseonly allows you to store Ammunition, while theMedicine casewill only hold Meds and Healing Kits. More containers are making their appearance in the game, all with different uses, such as theLucky Scav Junk boxand theT H I C C Weapon case.",
    "Many of thelocationsinEscape from Tarkovhave short-cuts that can cut down travel time, or provide access to certain areas with jumps in certain spots, more information regarding these shortcuts are located on their respectivemappages.",
    "The example below is a jump shortcut from \"Warehouse 4\" section of the map over a wall to the \"New gas station\" section onCustoms, this shortcut can cut down travel time by almost 2 minutes and avoids the necessity of aFactory emergency exit keyto get to the other side of the map.",

    "The map ofEscape from Tarkovconsists of 12 different locations of which 9 have been released so far. While all maps are to be connected eventually, for now they are all separated from each other.",
    "The map below links to the locations the player can deploy to.",
    "Minefield warning sign",
    "Border Sniper warning sign",
    "Claymore mine",
    "Minefields are usually marked by warning signs, but there are also a few unmarked ones (e.g. north of the USEC Camp onWoods).The mines are invisible, respawn after they detonate and can only be triggered by players. It is therefore impossible to detect a mine, let alone clear a minefield.While they are used to create artificial borders onWoods, they can also be found scattered around the water treatment plant onLighthouseand along the harbor terminal wall onShoreline.",
    "Border Snipers are marked by various warning signs.They are invisible, non-killable and can shoot through any object.They should be avoided under all circumstances, not at last because the player's health will be set to 1% after dying to them.It is therefore essential for survival to retreat immediately when being targeted by one, as taking cover is pointless.They are used to create artificial borders onCustoms,Lighthouse,Reserve,WoodsandStreets of Tarkov.",
    "Claymores are anti-personnel mines. The mines have an activation range of 5-10m and instantly kill players upon detonation. They are currently only used on theLighthouselocation, scattered on the bridge to the lighthouse at the peninsula territory, and on the hills eastern of the water treatment plant. The mines on the bridge to the lighthouse can be passed safely with an encodedDigital secure DSP radio transmitter.",

    "These are theapproximatesystem requirements[1]to runEscape from Tarkov.",
    "Note that these are the requirements found on the official website, they may differ from what is actually needed. \nDuring the testing phase the game will be optimized, so by the final release the system requirements may change, but not drastically.\nIf you have a system which is worse than the listed requirements, it doesn't mean that the game won't work.",
    "Ballisticsare an important part ofEscape from Tarkov. They play a big role in firefights and often determine the outcomes. Choosing the rightweapon,ammoand gear is one of the most important parts in coming out on top of fighting.",
    "Bullet flight is simulated realistically inEscape from Tarkov. Bullets have speed, are affected by gravity and air friction and can penetrate or ricochet when hitting objects, and even fragment when doing so. The specific flight characteristics of a bullet is determined by the ammo type, and the chance of a bullet penetrating or ricocheting off of an object is determined by the material of the object and the type of bullet. Bullets also lose both damage and penetration power as they lose speed from air friction over long distances.",
    "Escape from Tarkovsimulates damage to the body and body armor. Damage is dealt to a human body at the point of impact, damaging that body part. Bullets are also capable of penetrating walls and body parts, enabling the same round to damage multiple parts. Bullets can also fragment when penetrating a player's body, dealing 50% bonus damage to the affected body part (Note: Due to a bug this currently only works on limbs). The damage dealt by a bullet is based only on the bullet itself, and not by the gun it was fired from. Armor protection is also simulated realistically, stopping bullets entirely instead of providing a damage reduction like in most other games.",
    "Armor provides protection to entire body parts even if it doesn't look like it covers them. You can see what parts of the body are protected when you inspect the armor. When your body is hit, if that body part that was hit (or head zone) has body armor or a helmet protecting it, the game checks to see if the bullet penetrates or doesn't.",
    "The penetration chance of a bullet hitting armor is calculated based on the armor's level, the armor's remaining durability %, and the ammo's penetration value. The chance is then rolled to determine whether or not the bullet penetrates.",
    "If the bullet penetrates, it deals between 0% and 40% less damage based on an algorithm that uses the bullet's pen value and the armor's class and durability %. There is a strong correlation between the penetration chance the penetrating round had, and the damage reduction applied to it: The higher the chance the less damage reduction, with high armor classes and high pen values of ammo having lower reductions than others. Most penetrations will be around 20% damage reduction when a bullet starts to penetrate an armor, but things like a PACA vs M995 will result in 0% reduction.",
    "If the bullet does not penetrate, \"blunt damage\" is applied, which lets through a % of the base damage of the bullet to the body part hit. This % is based on the specific armor's \"blunt throughput\" stat, the pen value of the ammo, and the armor's class and remaining durability %. Blunt damage is extremely low and not a notable factor in kill speed against anything other than level 2 body armors.",
    "Durability of armor is important, the lower the current % of durability remaining the less protection the armor offers overall. The durability % is calculated by dividing the current durability of the armor by the original maximum durability of the armor. As an example a 60/60 repairedLBT-6094A Slick Plate Carrierarmor is calculated as 60/80, or 75%.",
    "The durability damage taken from bullets is based on the penetration value of the ammo and the armor level of the armor, multiplied by the ammo's armor damage % and the armor material's destructibility %. The minimum durability damage armor can take from a single hit is 1, including from individual buckshot pellets. Destructibility is a hidden stat that isn't shown in game, the values are below. A penetrating round does a little bit less durability damage to armor than a round that does not penetrate. It varies, but is usually around 10-15% less.",
    "If you want to find the effective durability of different armor to compare how durable different armors are, use the following formula: EffectiveDurability = Durability ÷ Destructibility\nIn the above example EffectiveDurability =0.75/0.6=1.25 which means it can still have more than it's maximum durability (100 hitpoints).",
    "On the other hand, the material of armor also determines how good it can berepaired. While ceramic armor likeZhuk-6aandGzhel-Kwill be almost broken after 2 repairs,SlickandKilla armorcan be repaired many times and still retain good defense.",
    "Hitboxes are always the same, whether you're clad in armor or completely naked, they never change in size or shape. Armor simply provides it's protection to specific hitboxes and head \"zones\", and when those hitboxes are struck by a bullet the armor protects them. So no matter what armor you're wearing they always provide the same area of protection to whatever body parts they say they protect on their inspection screen. So don't be fooled by what an armor looks like, check the protection zones to see what it actually protects.",
    "The angle of impact has no effect on armor except for helmets, which bullets can ricochet off of. If a bullet strikes a helmet within a certain range of angles, the round has a chance to ricochet determined by how shallow the angle is as well as the ricochet chance of the helmet. The required angles and the ricochet chance is determined by the helmet and is different for each individual helmet. If a ricochet occurs it is the same as the helmet stopping the penetration as far as the penetration calculation is concerned, and blunt damage and durability damage continue as they would normally, however the health and durability damage is significantly lowered to the point that there is almost no blunt damage received and the helmet almost always takes the minimum durability damage, which is 1.",
    "You can read an even more in-depth summary of all armor-related mechanics onNoFoodAfterMidnight'sbloghere.",
    "*Currently, there is a bug where the projectiles do not fragmentbelow 20 penetration power, regardless of the specified fragmentation chance.",
    "**Assuming all projectiles hit the target on every shot. Because each projectile causes a minimum of 1 durability loss to armor, it becomes effective at breaking down armor and eventually penetrating.",

    "Escape from Tarkovis a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG with MMO features developed by Russian Saint-Petersburg-based game developer, Battlestate Games. Set in the fictionalNorvinsk regionlocated on the frontier between Russia and Europe, the metropolis of Tarkov was plunged into anarchy thanks to the Contract Wars. What was once a bustling city, is now roamed by rivallingscavenger gangs, formerprivate military forces, andblack ops units.

    "For the bosses, seeBosses.For the raiders, seeScav Raiders.For the rogues, seeRogues.",
    "Scavengers, known by their alias \"Scavs\", are afactioninEscape from Tarkov.",
    "At the onset of active hostilities in the city, in addition to the predictable humanitarian consequences, a special trend is observed that represents a threat for both civilians and armed forces of the conflicting parties. Due to the tense situation in the city prior to the open conflict, Tarkov has developed conditions attractive for all kinds of criminals and antisocial personalities. In addition, the development of the underworld business, especially in recent years, has encouraged the formation of a certain population stratum previously not directly associated with criminals, but, due to their moral and ethical inclinations, prone to antisocial actions in certain cases concerned with their own benefit. Thus, at this point, the formation of groups actively engaged in looting, robbery and armed attacks can be observed in Tarkov, invariably coupled with violence against the civilian population and even military staff. Recently, these groups have earned a nickname from the locals - Scavs.",
    "The Scav groups are quite varied, have diverse ethnic, social and quantitative composition, as well as the different levels and quality of equipment and varying degrees of sustainability. By far, four of these groups are considered to be the most stable and organized:[1]",
    "Scavs are both AI and player controlled characters. All locations begin with Scavs already populating them, and more will arrive in waves throughout the duration of a raid. During some of these spawn waves, player controlled Scavs will join the raid. Scavs and player Scavs spawn with various random pieces of equipment and loot.",
    "AI Scavs are, for the most part, not a very large threat. They usually follow a basic patrol route of walking to a position, stopping, looking around for a bit, then continuing in another direction, or just standing in place looking back and forth. Occasionally they will check their magazines, say voice lines in russian or use gestures. These mannerisms are a good method to determine if a Scav is AI or player controlled. AI Scavs also sometimes pick up loot from corpses and equip it.",
    "In combat, lone Scavs are practically a non-threat, generally requiring one precise shot to the head or a few shots to their typically unarmored bodies to dispatch. In groups, Scavs will pose more of a threat, but are still bogged down by their subpar gear and rudimentary AI.",
    "They tend to be very inaccurate at first, getting more accurate with every follow up shot and exhibit a very basic understanding of tactics, such as using basic cover and running around a building, waiting around corners or next to doorways.",
    "AI Scavs have very little situational awareness, making it very easy to get the drop on a group of them. With a moderate amount of stealth, one can find a suitable spot to pick them off. The size of the groups they travel in vary widely, especially given the size of the location, but they typically patrol in groups of 3. Scavs will generally stick around landmarks and other important places, but will sometimes roam around the map instead, or pursuetagged and cursedplayers.",
    "However, Scavs should not be marked off as a non-threat entirely. AI Scavs tend to target every body part that is visible to them. E.g., if only your head is visible to them in a window or staircase, they will always target your head. Therefore, it is always better to peek with your full body towards an AI Scav, as that lowers the chances of them shooting at your head drastically. If you're not sure what you are facing is a Scav or PMC, always use an angled peek (hold E or Q respectively), as this shows your arm and part of your thorax, along with your head of course, instead of just your head. They have also been shown to have random moments where they are incredibly accurate and perfectly shoot a player in the head, can \"drop-shot\" players, and can spawn with powerful weapons with armor-piercing rounds. While this is not common, it is typically a death sentence when a Scav exhibits this level of intelligence, since they acquire targets incredibly fast, dodge your attempt to shoot them, are not hampered by things like sight lines and muzzle flash, and can shoot you in the head instantly before you can even register they're on screen. Scavs sometimes carry class 1-5 armor so be mindful when using rounds with low penetration power. When using ammo with high flesh damage, it is recommended to shoot at the legs, because if they do carry armor, it will ignore this armor and deal direct flesh damage. As a bonus, their armor stays mostly undamaged allowing you to loot it without having to repair it.",
    "There are 2 different health presets Scavs can have.",

    "Playing as a Scav is like playing the game without rules, one where the player can experience quite different gameplay with a focus on reckless abandon. The Scav player is spawned together with AI Scavs, carrying a randomized set of equipment. For example, the player Scav will spawn part-way through a raid in one of several set spawn points. Scav tactics change up the overall style of raid gameplay, and in most cases, complicating the lives ofBEARandUSECplayers, while also fighting among themselves.",
    "When you join a raid as a Scav, you are neutral with all normal AI Scavs. That means they will not shoot you or react negatively in any way. However, if you attack any Scav you become a \"traitor\" and all nearby AI Scavs will become hostile. You won't become a traitor if you attack or kill a player Scav who hit you first, or was already marked as a traitor to nearby AI Scavs.Scav Raiders, as well asScav Bossesand their followers won't bother you as long as you don't get too close to them.",
    "The most important thing about playing as Scav is that if you get killed in the raid, you will not lose anything from your main character's possessions, and if you survive, you can add whatever you looted to your stash. In other words, this is an alternative way to find and save items and to take part in combat, but without the risk of losing everything brought into the Raid.",
    "Your Scav character is progressing separately from your main PMC character. Level and skill progress carry over between raids, even though the character names imply different persons. The skills and overall statistics of your Scav can only be viewed in-raid currently.",
    "Upgrading the intelligence center in yourHideoutwill allow you to reduce the cooldown timer for the Scav game mode:",
    "Similar tooperational tasksfor your PMC character, there are also daily tasks for your Scav character. They can be obtained fromFenceafter you built theHideoutmodule \"Intelligence Center\". The rewards for these tasks are largely randomized and can give a variety of items andScav karma. If you do not want the task you have been given, you can pay someEurosor take aScav karmapenalty for a new random task. The objectives are highly varying, and need to be solely done with your Scav character.",
    "Scav karma is a system that was implemented to incentivise cooperation between player Scavs rather than shooting each other on sight. Different actions cause different changes to your karma level. Your current karma can be found asFence trader reputation.",
    "Note:If you have 6+ karma, penalties are calculated as if you had +6 karma. E.g. if you have +27 karma and kill a player Scav (-0.1), you will end up at +5.9.",
    "Your Scav karma affects the following things:",
    "The effects mentioned above change every whole number (+1, -4 etc.).",
    "Note that the primary weapons can have numerous mod variations and those shown below are examples.",

    "Expanded the Lighthouse location - added the ability to visit the island where the lighthouse is located, and also added new interiors inside the water treatment plant facility complex.\nAdded three new bosses - the commanders of the ex-USEC PMC group known as Rogues. The leader of the gang is Knight, who coordinates the actions of the entire group and specializes in assault operations. Birdeye maintains distance between him and the enemy, setting up ambushes and choosing positions with a clear line of sight to the area. Big Pipe prefers the grenade launcher and serves the role of massive firepower in battle and always rushes towards the enemy to reach combat distance.\nBosses maintain contact with each other and with the other Rogues, however they don’t stick together and instead keep their positioning distances. When an enemy is detected by any of the bosses or Rogues, information on enemy location is transmitted to everyone by radio, and the bosses prepare for battle, taking up tactical positions for engagement.",
    "Bosses help each other, use all available weapons, and are hostile to everyone: players of any faction, Scavs, and Raiders. They don't communicate with the rest of the bosses and Fence, so they attack any enemy immediately. Killing them does not affect the player's reputation.",
    "The bosses' habitats are Lighthouse, Shoreline, Woods, and Customs. They do not stay in one place and instead wander through these locations all the time. If the bosses have moved to one of the maps, they will be absent on the others. There is no timetable for their movement and no one knows what the bosses are guided by when changing their location.",
    "Added new weapons and customization for them:",
    "AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution (FSR) - an image scaling technology in modern 3D games that allows you to increase performance with minimal loss in the quality of the final image.

The Performance mode is only available for 4K Ultra HD resolutions (3840x2160) and higher.",
    "Temporarily disabled the ability to enable Mip Streaming in the graphics settings. We are currently reworking this function and will re-enable it in the nearest updates.\nUpdated the NVidia Reflex version.\nReworked laser sights for all tactical devices: with IR mode enabled, the lasers and flashlights will not be visible since they are designed for use with NVGs. Also, the intensity and brightness of standard non-IR lasers has been increased.\nSounds:",
    "With this, it became possible to achieve maximum correspondence with the real life data. Also, the loss of all types of damage, depending on the energy of the bullet at a distance, and the increase in damage and penetration of the bullet from the change in bullet velocity have been corrected. For example, for 5.45x39 at a distance of 150 meters, the drop in damage was about 20%, but when changing the barrel for a longer one, thus increasing the velocity, the damage and penetrative abilities also increase. However, it’s worth understanding that for some ammunition there is no data in open sources, or they are incomplete. Such ammunition will be adjusted as the necessary data is found.",

    "Norvinsk Zone",
    "The events ofEscape from Tarkovtake place in the fictional Norvinsk region Special Economic Zone that became a gateway between Russia and Europe. Preferential conditions for large international companies, however, have not only attracted law-abiding businesses, but corporations of dubious intent as well. InTarkov, one of the largest cities of the region, a transatlantic corporation became the ground zero of a political scandal. Six months later, the political standoff escalated into an armed conflict involving UN peacekeepers, Internal Troops of Ministry of Internal Affairs, and twoprivate military companies. The region's borders were sealed off, and those trapped in the middle of flaring up local warfare were isolated from the outside world.",
    "Tarkov",
    "Tarkovis a city in the Russian Northwest, a municipal entity within Norvinsk region, and one of the two principal cities of theNorvinskSpecial Economic Zone.",
    "With each passing day the situation in theNorvinsk regiongrows more and more complicated. Incessant warfare in Tarkov has sparked massive panic; local populations flee the city, but those who stayed are looking to improve their fortunes at the expense of others. Having accepted the new reality, “savage” Tarkov locals—Scavs—flocked into well-armed gangs and started the re-division of the city. Nowadays, Tarkov is separated by unseen borders, controlled by different groups. Gain-greedy gunmen would go to any length to get their way, including murder of civilians and direct confrontation with the two private military companies.",
    "The players will have to experience living in the skin of one of the mercenaries who survived the initial stage of the Tarkov conflict. After choosing one of the sides – USEC or BEAR – a player's character starts to make his way out of the city. Tarkov is sealed off by UN Peacekeepers and the Russian military, supply chains are cut, communication with operational command is lost, and in these conditions everyone has to make their own choices of what to do and how to get out of the chaos-ridden metropolis.",
    "The city is located on the eastern shore of the shallow (max depth 2.5-3.5 m at 200 m from the shore) Lake Bay of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. The coast is covered by a ridge of dunes and hills covered in vegetation, interrupted sometimes by river valleys, small lakes, ponds, and patches of exposed moraines. Sandy (\"Golden\") beach up to 50 m wide.",
    "In the Paleozoic Era (300-400 million years ago) the entire area was covered by the sea. Sediments of the time — sand, sandy clay, clay with lenses of silt or peat — thickly covered (with over 200m of layers) a bedrock composed of granite, gneiss and diabases. Modern relief was formed as a result of the activities of the glacier (the latest Valdai glaciation that took place 12 thousand years ago). The retreating glacier formed the Littorina sea, whose level was at 7–9 m above the modern one. 4 thousand years ago the sea level dropped, and the shoals of the Gulf has turned into islands. Valley is formed with glaciolacustrine and postglacial sediments. Over the last 2.5 thousand years the relief stayed largely the same.",
    "The Tarkov climate is temperate and humid, transitional from maritime to continental. The daytime length varies from 5:51 hrs on 22 December to 18:50 hrs June 22. The city area is characterized by frequent changes of air masses due to activities of the cyclones which pass along the Gulf which leads to great volatility of weather, especially in autumn and winter. Winters are mild, with moderately cold, mostly cloudy weather. Snow cover settles in the second half of November and lasts until mid-April. Spring is usually late and protracted. Summers are moderately warm, with roughly equivalently interchanging sunny and rainy days. Autumn is mostly overcast and foggy. Rainfall is about 650mm per year, mostly in June–August. The average annual relative humidity is about 80%, with highest in December (90%). Summer is dominated by Western and North-Western winds, and Western and South-Western in winter. The climate in Tarkov is close to that in Norvinsk. The Gulf of Finland, despite its shallowness, has some effect on the temperature profile of the city. In the summer, especially in August and September, mean air temperature is a bit higher than in Norvinsk (about 0.5-0.8 °C higher), and lower in the winter (about 0.5-0.6 °C lower). Also, winds are generally a bit more powerful on the coast as well.",
    "Prior to the establishment of the city the area was covered with coniferous forests (pine and spruce) mixed with broadleaf species and lowland marshes. At the moment, the city vicinity has preserved large conifers (pine predominates) interchanging with deciduous groves (birch, alder, aspen, willow). Dominated by sandy soils, on lacustrine and alluvial sands - subaerial podzolic, in conjunction with peat - podzolic-Gley soils. The city vicinity is populated by the occasionally spotted foxes and muskrats. The city itself is home to large number of birds, reptiles and invertebrates.",
    "According to the population census of 2002, Tarkov had a population of 402 272 persons, 46.1% of them male, 53.9% female.",
    "In 2008, the population was of 949 340.",
    "The representative body of the local government - the Municipal Council — has been functioning since 1997. By the results of March 1, 2011 elections, a new staff filled the 4th convocation (of 22 delegates: 13 — from United Russia, 5 from Just Russia, 4 from the Communist Party, and 2 independent candidates). The Tarkov urban municipal district is lead by the Head (Mayor) of the municipal district. The executive and administrative body of the local government is represented by the local administration of the city of Tarkov.",
    "The head of the Tarkov Municipal District is Dmitry Vasilyevich Vishnevsky.\nThe head of the local administration of the Tarkov Municipal District is Andrey Gennadyevich Samsonov.",
    "The city is based on the hydronym Tarka, after the name of a river (38 km long, flows into the Gulf of Finland), which mouth is located in the East of the city.",

    "The city hosts several industries: The Tarkov Instruments factory, the Bakery, the Salut sewing factory, Information Satellite Systems JSC, Granit-M chemical plant No. 16",
    "The internal city public transport includes buses and minibuses of the Tarkov motor pool (a branch of \"Pitergortrans\") and the commercial minibuses. The internal city routes of the Tarkov motor pool have their own numeric system, independent from St. Petersburg of Sestroretsk.",
    "A major part of the long-distance commuting is directed to St. Petersburg, Sestroretsk and Norvinsk and divided by four traffic flows:",
    "Today, Tarkov is abundant with objects of social and commercial infrastructure. The city is getting actively colonized by the major trade networks.",

    "Locations marked on map",
    "Note:It is rare, but possible that they appear in the health resort and at one of the other two locations in the same raid.",
    "Cultists lurk in the shadows in groups of 3-5, waiting for a player to approach. They silently approach their enemies and stab them using either normal knives or, in case of the priests, the poisonedCultist knife. If fired upon, the Cultists will return fire using firearms and grenades. After they attack a player with their knife, they may choose to run off into the woods again and attempt to attack the player(s) from the shadows once again. Some Cultists have been seen to prone in the grass or hide in bushes while their companions engage the player(s) with weapons, then attack with their knives when it's least expected.",
    "Cultist warriors will ignore scavs, scav guards, bosses, and scav players, but may shoot scav players on sight if aggravated. Cultist priests will attempt to run to cover whenever a scav player comes too close to their current location, and may shoot on sight if also aggravated.",
    "As the Cultists prefer to ambush players and are extremely well hidden, they almost always have the initiative. Thus, it is important for players to quickly determine exactly where the Cultists are and attempt to regain the initiative. Cultists appear to always have suppressors and stick to cover, so players must be able to quickly spot them in the trees, especially at night. OnWoods, players should be especially careful when traveling through either of the Marked Circles on the map. Additionally, Cultists have been seen to stalk players and open fire on them unprovoked, even if they must travel away from the Marked Circles. Players should be extremely cautious as the Cultists use ammo with high-penetrative power and rarely spawn with grenades. Cultists may spawn with a variety of armor, ranging from no protection to class 6 armor, however, they rarely, if at all, use headgear, so headshots are certainly a viable option.",
    "If stabbed by theCultist knife, players will be inflicted by theUnknown toxindebuff, which deals gradual damage over time and causes pain. The toxin can be cured by thexTG-12 antidote injectororAugmentin antibiotic pillsotherwise, the player must extract from the raid or they will run out of medication and die.",

    "Scav raiders are advancedScavsthat are considerably stronger and more tactical than everydayScavs. They fight in groups, often patrolling theLab, andReservein small squads of three/four members. Raiders employ multiple different weapons and tactics, not afraid to flank, rush, and pin down intruding PMCs. Extreme discretion is required when facing Raiders, as unprepared players will often be shot down almost instantly. Raiders often say voice lines while patrolling or fighting and are easily distinguished from Scavs when speaking English.\nScav Raiders start out neutral to other Scavs (including player Scavs), but will get irritated and shout warnings when they get too close. If the warning is ignored, they will open fire. If some other Scav has alerted a raider, it becomes hostile to all other non-raider Scavs; it is safer to always assume that they are hostile. Raiders spawn throughout theLablocation, and spawn frequently onReserve, often spawning at the beginning of a raid in the control room and in the tunnels, as well as from Hermetic Door activation, D2 activation, and the arrival of the Armored Train extract.",
    "Bossesfollowers have a similar logic, with the exception that the boss gets angry without a warning.",
    "Because Raiders are able to have Class 5/6 Body Armor or Armored Rigs, it is best to bring high penetration ammo. Without AP rounds, aiming for the face is vital, as the hitboxes for the Eyes and Jaws will be protected by, at most, Class 3 face shields; however, other head hitboxes won't have any armor class higher than 4. Also, peeking the same angle twice is highly discouraged as Raiders will watch an angle if you peek it once so it is best to regularly change your position. It is also best to engage Raiders in close range or in enclosed spaces as there is more cover and it is much easier to land headshots in close range, plus there are places to retreat to, as Raiders are able to use grenades, making any room with one exit a death sentence. It is also useful to use grenades for your own advantage, grenades are very useful at flushing Raiders out, forcing them out of any cover they may have, which will put them out in the open where they can be dispatched. If attempting to fight Raiders as a Scav on Reserve most of your fights will be in the open area in between Rook/Train Station and the K Buildings, as most of the time the ones in the tunnels beneath the helicopter will already have been killed. If engaging outside of Rook Raiders will usually attempt to find cover once being shot instead of instantly shooting back. This isnotan excuse to push further, as rushing their cover will result in your immediate death. Raiders generally run to cover if you are far enough away, within a short range they will often shoot you on the spot. Because of this behavior what you should do next depends on your weapon. If you have a sniper (such as aMosinRifle,SV-98, or other Bolt Action Rifle) it is best to take position on top of Rook/Train Station and shoot them from there and simply wait for them to peek you because after enough time they will often come out of cover if they reach it, especially if another Scav has aggravated them. If you have a shotgun it is best to shoot them from mid range and duck to cover such as inside Rook/Train Station or K Buildings to force them to push you, then just aim for the face, with enough skill (and/or luck) you can dispatch them (Bottleneck and Blitzkrieg). If you have an Assault Rifle either push towards them and get close and aim for face or use the shotgun's strategy. If attempting to fight raiders in the tunnels, using a Bolt-Action is discouraged, although Shotguns have proved very useful. Attempt to engage them in the main area and then rotate using the side tunnels to flank and get closer. Don't get greedy and try to kill more than one at a time, if it seems like a room has 2 raiders in it, use grenades to flush them out and rush. Remember to aim at head level.",

    "The AK-74M (Avtomat Kalashnikova 74 Modernizirovanny - \"Kalashnikov's Automatic rifle 74 Modernized\") 5.45x39mm assault rifle is a full-scale produced modernized version of the AK-74 that offers more versatility compared with its predecessor. Apart from several minor improvements, such as a lightened bolt and carrier assembly to reduce the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier during firing, the rifle features a new glass-filled polyamide stock that retains the shape of the original AK-74 fixed laminated wood stock, but side-folds to the left like the skeletonised AKS-74 buttstock, and also a dovetail side mount for installing various scopes. The AK-74M is a main service rifle of the Russian Federation.",

It's a variant of the M1911, and has been the standard-issue side arm for the Force Recon Element of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Units since 1985. The improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote finish.",

    "A Rogue mounting aNSV \"Utyos\" machine gun",
    "Rogues defend the water treatment plant by patrolling the area and manning emplaced weapons. They will open fire on players who come near the plant, but are more lenient towardsUSECPMCs andScavs. ToUSEC, Rogues will only engage once they have entered the plant, unless they are in a group with aBEARPMC.",
    "Rogues often patrol in groups of 2-3, and will make use of highly accurate suppressive fire while pushing players. They are extremely dangerous both in close-quarters and medium-range combat, capable of firing in full-auto with laser-like accuracy. They may also use flash grenades or fragmentation grenades against their enemies. Rogues manning either theNSV machine gunsorAGS-30 grenade machine gunswill typically spot players within 200 to 250 meters, but have been observed to shoot even up to 500 meters accurately. If they are wounded while on a mounted weapon they will abandon the position to fall back and heal before returning to the mounted weapon. If a Rogue manning a mounted weapon is killed, he may be replaced by another Rogue if there is another on the rooftop.",
    "If a USEC player engages the Rogues, they will be considered hostile for their next 3 raids.",
    "Rogues will not designate player Scavs as hostile on sight, only when they are shot at or otherwise provoked by standing too close. Also, if you climb a tower or a machine gun, you become an enemy for them.",
    "If this happens, they will be considered hostile until the end of the raid. Rogues are subject to shoot on sight any players nearby if they were shot recently including Scavs and PMCs alike no matter yourScav karma.",
    "Rogues are similar toRaidersin terms of equipment. Because of this, high-tier ammo is advised, although Rogues do not wear faceshields, so one can try to aim for the face with lower-tier ammo. Rogues hold corners if a hostile PMC is spotted, so be aware to not peek twice.",
    "One way of dispatching Rogues on the mounted machine guns and grenade launchers in the towers is sniping. One key vantage point are the rocks on the beach where you can often snipe the rogues on the southeast entrance of the compound. There are many other sniping locations around the water treatment plant that work for clearing rogues in this manner. Look for rocks overlooking the base to the east and south of the treatment plant.",
    "Beware when approaching the camp, Rogues are accurate and use high tier weapons and ammo that can kill on the first shot. Rogues often travel in groups of 3-4 and suppress and advance on players they spot. A group of PMCs can have one person distract the Rogues while others flank around them. Solo players will often have to reposition similar to regular PVP fights or other raider engagements to outsmart the AI. There are static rogue spawns on the buildings around the plant and on the machine guns, but there is commonly a roaming group of rogues that patrol the interior of the water treatment plant.",
    "For USEC PMCs (or passive scavs) who have not yet been flagged as hostile by rogues: With aRGNorRGOimpact grenade, they may be able to get close enough and take out a whole group with one grenade before the rogues open fire. Rogues will fire upon BEAR PMCs with no warning, making this harder to pull off.",

    "Scavengers, known by their alias \"Scavs\", are afactioninEscape from Tarkov.",
    "At the onset of active hostilities in the city, in addition to the predictable humanitarian consequences, a special trend is observed that represents a threat for both civilians and armed forces of the conflicting parties. Due to the tense situation in the city prior to the open conflict, Tarkov has developed conditions attractive for all kinds of criminals and antisocial personalities. In addition, the development of the underworld business, especially in recent years, has encouraged the formation of a certain population stratum previously not directly associated with criminals, but, due to their moral and ethical inclinations, prone to antisocial actions in certain cases concerned with their own benefit. Thus, at this point, the formation of groups actively engaged in looting, robbery and armed attacks can be observed in Tarkov, invariably coupled with violence against the civilian population and even military staff. Recently, these groups have earned a nickname from the locals - Scavs.",
    "The Scav groups are quite varied, have diverse ethnic, social and quantitative composition, as well as the different levels and quality of equipment and varying degrees of sustainability. By far, four of these groups are considered to be the most stable and organized:[1]",
    "Scavs are both AI and player controlled characters. All locations begin with Scavs already populating them, and more will arrive in waves throughout the duration of a raid. During some of these spawn waves, player controlled Scavs will join the raid. Scavs and player Scavs spawn with various random pieces of equipment and loot.",
    "AI Scavs are, for the most part, not a very large threat. They usually follow a basic patrol route of walking to a position, stopping, looking around for a bit, then continuing in another direction, or just standing in place looking back and forth. Occasionally they will check their magazines, say voice lines in russian or use gestures. These mannerisms are a good method to determine if a Scav is AI or player controlled. AI Scavs also sometimes pick up loot from corpses and equip it.",
    "In combat, lone Scavs are practically a non-threat, generally requiring one precise shot to the head or a few shots to their typically unarmored bodies to dispatch. In groups, Scavs will pose more of a threat, but are still bogged down by their subpar gear and rudimentary AI.",
    "They tend to be very inaccurate at first, getting more accurate with every follow up shot and exhibit a very basic understanding of tactics, such as using basic cover and running around a building, waiting around corners or next to doorways.",
    "AI Scavs have very little situational awareness, making it very easy to get the drop on a group of them. With a moderate amount of stealth, one can find a suitable spot to pick them off. The size of the groups they travel in vary widely, especially given the size of the location, but they typically patrol in groups of 3. Scavs will generally stick around landmarks and other important places, but will sometimes roam around the map instead, or pursuetagged and cursedplayers.",
    "However, Scavs should not be marked off as a non-threat entirely. AI Scavs tend to target every body part that is visible to them. E.g., if only your head is visible to them in a window or staircase, they will always target your head. Therefore, it is always better to peek with your full body towards an AI Scav, as that lowers the chances of them shooting at your head drastically. If you're not sure what you are facing is a Scav or PMC, always use an angled peek (hold E or Q respectively), as this shows your arm and part of your thorax, along with your head of course, instead of just your head. They have also been shown to have random moments where they are incredibly accurate and perfectly shoot a player in the head, can \"drop-shot\" players, and can spawn with powerful weapons with armor-piercing rounds. While this is not common, it is typically a death sentence when a Scav exhibits this level of intelligence, since they acquire targets incredibly fast, dodge your attempt to shoot them, are not hampered by things like sight lines and muzzle flash, and can shoot you in the head instantly before you can even register they're on screen. Scavs sometimes carry class 1-5 armor so be mindful when using rounds with low penetration power. When using ammo with high flesh damage, it is recommended to shoot at the legs, because if they do carry armor, it will ignore this armor and deal direct flesh damage. As a bonus, their armor stays mostly undamaged allowing you to loot it without having to repair it.",

    "Playing as a Scav is like playing the game without rules, one where the player can experience quite different gameplay with a focus on reckless abandon. The Scav player is spawned together with AI Scavs, carrying a randomized set of equipment. For example, the player Scav will spawn part-way through a raid in one of several set spawn points. Scav tactics change up the overall style of raid gameplay, and in most cases, complicating the lives ofBEARandUSECplayers, while also fighting among themselves.",
    "When you join a raid as a Scav, you are neutral with all normal AI Scavs. That means they will not shoot you or react negatively in any way. However, if you attack any Scav you become a \"traitor\" and all nearby AI Scavs will become hostile. You won't become a traitor if you attack or kill a player Scav who hit you first, or was already marked as a traitor to nearby AI Scavs.Scav Raiders, as well asScav Bossesand their followers won't bother you as long as you don't get too close to them.",
    "The most important thing about playing as Scav is that if you get killed in the raid, you will not lose anything from your main character's possessions, and if you survive, you can add whatever you looted to your stash. In other words, this is an alternative way to find and save items and to take part in combat, but without the risk of losing everything brought into the Raid.",
    "Your Scav character is progressing separately from your main PMC character. Level and skill progress carry over between raids, even though the character names imply different persons. The skills and overall statistics of your Scav can only be viewed in-raid currently.",
    "Upgrading the intelligence center in yourHideoutwill allow you to reduce the cooldown timer for the Scav game mode:",
    "Similar tooperational tasksfor your PMC character, there are also daily tasks for your Scav character. They can be obtained fromFenceafter you built theHideoutmodule \"Intelligence Center\". The rewards for these tasks are largely randomized and can give a variety of items andScav karma. If you do not want the task you have been given, you can pay someEurosor take aScav karmapenalty for a new random task. The objectives are highly varying, and need to be solely done with your Scav character.",
    "Scav karma is a system that was implemented to incentivise cooperation between player Scavs rather than shooting each other on sight. Different actions cause different changes to your karma level. Your current karma can be found asFence trader reputation.",
    "Note:If you have 6+ karma, penalties are calculated as if you had +6 karma. E.g. if you have +27 karma and kill a player Scav (-0.1), you will end up at +5.9.",

If you do not want the task you have been given, you can pay the trader someroublesand take a reputation penalty for a new random task.",

    "",
    "Shturman and his two followers will engage the player at a long range protecting the sawmill area of the woods. They prefer to keep their distance, as they are not suited for close quarters combat. \nThey also like to take positions between hard cover, or camouflage themselves with the environment.\nAdditionally, it is not unheard of for one of the guards to flank or rush the player(s) while Shturman and the other guard hold positions and keep the player(s) pinned down. It is also good to note that Shturman will fire warning shots (Usually 3-5) before locking onto his target, these warning shots only occur if the target is far enough away where they pose no immediate threat to Shturman himself.",
    "When both followers are killed Shturman tends to take shelter in places like wooden barracks.",
    "Shturman always has two followers, each with high caliber weapons and deadly accuracy.",
    "Their weapons alternate between various semi-automatic rifles and an occasionalVSS, and also have class 3 -> class 6Armor vests.\nEach rifle is loaded with ammo that is ideal for shredding all types of armor, so one should beware of staying out in the open for too long.",
    "All of the followers' last name is Svetloozerskiy, similar to theReshalaGuards",
    "It is recommended that the player(s) take the initiative when engaging the Boss. As the boss and his guards are often spread out, it is best to first recon the area and figure out where they are, then eliminate one of them, preferably the boss, with a single, well-placed headshot with more than 62 flesh damage, anything lower than 62 will take 2 headshots to kill. As neither the boss nor his guards wear helmets, headshots are the best way to go, given that guards are often decently armored and the boss has high chest health.",
    "Unless one is confident in their abilities, it is highly recommended to not engage in long-range combat, as the Boss and his guards are equipped for this exact purpose and snipe with deadly accuracy. As such, it is recommend to close the distance as much as possible, especially given that the Boss and his guards have semi-automatic weapons, and, on occasion, bolt actionMosins. However, the guards do utilize grenades, so one should be as careful as possible when moving up.",

    "Shturman can be found on theWoodslocation. He and his guards spawn at the sawmill that is located right next to big lake in the south:",
    "",
    "Shturman and his two followers will engage the player at a long range protecting the sawmill area of the woods. They prefer to keep their distance, as they are not suited for close quarters combat. \nThey also like to take positions between hard cover, or camouflage themselves with the environment.\nAdditionally, it is not unheard of for one of the guards to flank or rush the player(s) while Shturman and the other guard hold positions and keep the player(s) pinned down. It is also good to note that Shturman will fire warning shots (Usually 3-5) before locking onto his target, these warning shots only occur if the target is far enough away where they pose no immediate threat to Shturman himself.",
    "When both followers are killed Shturman tends to take shelter in places like wooden barracks.",
    "Shturman always has two followers, each with high caliber weapons and deadly accuracy.",
    "Their weapons alternate between various semi-automatic rifles and an occasionalVSS, and also have class 3 -> class 6Armor vests.\nEach rifle is loaded with ammo that is ideal for shredding all types of armor, so one should beware of staying out in the open for too long.",
    "All of the followers' last name is Svetloozerskiy, similar to theReshalaGuards",
    "It is recommended that the player(s) take the initiative when engaging the Boss. As the boss and his guards are often spread out, it is best to first recon the area and figure out where they are, then eliminate one of them, preferably the boss, with a single, well-placed headshot with more than 62 flesh damage, anything lower than 62 will take 2 headshots to kill. As neither the boss nor his guards wear helmets, headshots are the best way to go, given that guards are often decently armored and the boss has high chest health.",
    "Unless one is confident in their abilities, it is highly recommended to not engage in long-range combat, as the Boss and his guards are equipped for this exact purpose and snipe with deadly accuracy. As such, it is recommend to close the distance as much as possible, especially given that the Boss and his guards have semi-automatic weapons, and, on occasion, bolt actionMosins. However, the guards do utilize grenades, so one should be as careful as possible when moving up.",

    "After an offer has been fulfilled, all proceeds will be mailed to the player via the in-game merchant \"Ragman\". These proceeds will be available to be picked up for 7 days, after which they will expire and become unobtainable.",
